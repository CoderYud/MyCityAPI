# MyCityAPI
This application used WeatherAPI to check the current weather of the inputted city and used CityAPI to get information like latitude, longitude or nearby city within a certain miles, etc.

To run the application, we have a sample makefile that you can edit to run using command lines or you can do the following:
*This was compiled on vscode
  javac -cp .:json-java.jar MyCity.java
  java -cp .:json-java.jar MyCity (Seattle) <--- enter the city you want

*Things that can be added or improved for this application is to create a front-end to display our information. Also, the application only used a little bit of CityAPI to get information so we can explore and utilize it more
